## Priorities

1. **Drawing Settings** - Users will be able to manipulate layer visibility, colors, and text of elevation drawings among other things. Sets of settings can be saved under a user-named configuration so that you can select any config and all settings will switch to that configuration. This can help switch quickly between fab views, customer views, and/or other custom views you require.
2. **Reports View** - Create a reports view to produce reports/exports easily and in batches. Users will be able to create named configurations of reports to produce a custom batch of printouts and/or exports. We will add ability to customize the location of exports according to user-defined template paths (eg. `C:\\WinBidPro\\{JobName}\\{Timestamp}`  to produce something like `C:\\WinBidPro\\My Job\\2022-05-27-1230\\report-here.pdf`)
3. **Support CAD details uploads** - Users will be able to upload their own cad details. They will be able to view these details and reference them in framing or entrance systems.
4. **Glass hatch patterns/colors** - Users will be able to specify the color and fill pattern of products and apply a default to any that are left unspecified.
5. **Horizontal SSG support** - Verticals SSG support already exists. This will allow horizontals to also be SSG in a similar manner.
6. **Performance improvements** - We will continue to speed up the program by reducing the number of requests to the server required by various views and optimizing the UI.

## Wishlist

1. **Manufacturer mode** - to allow manfacturers to publish changes to their data themselves
2. **Custom Vendors** - allow users to create a custom vendor.
3. **Cost per Elevation Report**
