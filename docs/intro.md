# Getting Started

## Choose Your Vendor Catalogs
Before creating estimates (Jobs) in v16, you will need to select the catalogs you would like to use. Since this software uses web-hosted data, there is no need to install catalogs, it is simply a matter of selecting the ones you want.
The first time you use v16, you will be prompted to selected catalogs, but if you need to add more later, you can:
1. Click on the `Catalogs` menu
2. Then click `Manage Vendors`

You can select the catalog to use when you create a new job. The jobs list will show you all of your jobs from any vendor.

## Know Your Catalogs
We always recommend that you familiarize yourself with the vendor catalog you will use to create jobs. Most catalogs available in v16 have list pricing already configured. A discount multiplier of 1 is set to all parts by default, so it is up to you to enter your company's multipliers for a certain vendor.
